# CogniFlow - Intelligent Adaptive Learning System

## Problem Statement

Most online learning and exam platforms follow a static approach where every student receives the same questions, feedback, and learning path. This "one-size-fits-all" methodology fails to address individual student strengths, weaknesses, and unique learning behaviors, leading to suboptimal educational outcomes.

## Solution

CogniFlow is an intelligent, adaptive system designed to personalize the learning experience. It continuously learns from a student's interactions—including quiz performance, response patterns, and forum discussions—to provide customized assessments, performance predictions, and guidance in real-time.
